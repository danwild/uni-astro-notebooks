    "Algol (the “demon” star in Arabic) is a semidetached binary. Every 2.87 days, its brilliance is reduced by more than half as it undergoes a deep eclipse, its apparent magnitude dimming from 2.1 to 3.4. The system consists of a B8 main-sequence star and a late-type (G or K) subgiant; the deep eclipses occur when the larger cooler star (the subgiant) moves in front of its smaller brighter companion. \n",

    "The “Algol paradox”, which troubled astronomers in the first half of the twentieth century, is that accord- ing to the ideas of stellar evolution discussed in Section 10.6 of the textbook, the more massive B8 star should have been the first to evolve off the main sequence. What is your solution to this paradox?\n",
